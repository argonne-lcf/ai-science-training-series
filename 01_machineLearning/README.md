# Introduction to Machine Learning

The following examples introduce concepts that will be very important to modern AI training workflows, but can also be used in some methods you may already be familiar with. We hope the examples help clarify these methods.

0. [Building a Dataset (optional)](00_make_slimmed_dataset.ipynb)
1. [Fitting a line with Stochastic Gradient Descent](01_linear_regression_sgd.ipynb)
2. [k-means: Another learning method for clustering data](02_clustering.ipynb)
