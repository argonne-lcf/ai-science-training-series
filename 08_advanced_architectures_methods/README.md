 **Homework**
 
 Submit a paragraph about: 
 
- How could you use AI for a problem that interests you? 
- What is the task? 
- What kind of data would you use? 
- What kind of method or model might be appropriate? 
- What kind of metric would you use to measure success? 

Feel free to consult the Internet for ideas.

This paragraph can be placed in a README in git and you can submit the link. 


As a part of a large team, I am currently working on developing a search based AI for a set of quantum games such as quantum chess. The game of quantum chase offers quantum moves on top of the standard ruleset for the well known game of chess. The classical check-mate position can be avoided in quantum chess as complete capture of the opponent's king is a winning condition. The goal is to deveelop an efficient AI player for the game of Quantum Chess more or less on the lines of AlphaZero. To be able to test the efficacy of deep learning methods for the development of a powerful robotic playing agent we are in the process of generating gameplay data based on human play as well as auto generated games with two different search-based AI methods playing against each other such as Minimax and MCTS. The auto generated data could be used in the reinforcement learning framework to develop a stronnger AI that uses NN and MCTS type tree-search methods. The success of the AI player that uses neural network based strategies would obviously depend on how it performs against human players and against other AI players. Another metric would be how qquickly the deeep-learning based AI resorts to the quantum moves in the case of classical checkp-mate scenarios.
