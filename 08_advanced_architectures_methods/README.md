 **Homework**
 
 Submit a paragraph about: 
 
- How could you use AI for a problem that interests you? 
- What is the task? 
- What kind of data would you use? 
- What kind of method or model might be appropriate? 
- What kind of metric would you use to measure success? 

Feel free to consult the Internet for ideas.

This paragraph can be placed in a README in git and you can submit the link.
