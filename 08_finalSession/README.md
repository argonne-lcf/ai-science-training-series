## Homework 08

I am a PhD student working in leveraging Data Science and ML methods to improve the life of people in cities. Right now my research focuses on trying to understand travel demand behavior shift after the pandemic because this is a main input for transportation planning. The data I am using are tweets about working from home and telecommuting in general to see how people's perception on this evolved throughout the pandemic and try to find a way to generalize this understanding. Since tweets are mainly text data, I am training a transformers model to classify peoples's opinion. I have manually labeled thousands of tweets and started using pre-trained models which take around 4 hours to train acheiving aroung 81% accuracy. With the things I have learned I think I can tweak my model to increase its accuracy and train it in a fraction of the time because now I have the knowledge to do so if I get the right hardware for this task.
