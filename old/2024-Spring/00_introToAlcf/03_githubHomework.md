# GitHub Introduction: Homework Submissions

You will submit weekly homeworks via this [Homework Form](https://forms.office.com/g/0DvK4rxQWe)
The form expects you to submit a URL to a file on [github.com](github.com). You will need an account on [GitHub](github.com) to do this.

You will also need to setup SSH Keys on github and in your ALCF account. 
* The SSH Key setup is [described here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
* Setup git on Polaris (or target machine):
```bash
git config --global user.name "<first-name> <last-name>"
git config --global user.user "<github-username>"
git config --global user.email "<github-email-address>"
```

Navigate to the main page of this repository and follow the steps below. If you need help with logging into ALCF, please have a look [HERE](10_howToLogin.md).

## Fork the repo on GitHub

This repository is controled by the ALCF account space, but you can make a copy in to your own github account space by _forking_ the repository as show here. Simply go to the main repository page and click the _fork_ button on the top right.

## Clone the repo in your Home directory

After you have forked the repo, login to Polaris, and _clone_ the repository in to your home directory.

The command looks like `git clone git@github.com:<your-github-account>/ai-science-training-series.git` and it will _clone_ the repo into a directory named `ai-science-training-series`.

## Do your homework

Some homework can be done via Jupyter notebooks, and others will be source code.

When you sign in to our Jupyter server, you see the contents of your home directory. There you can open your repository and create a new file with an appropriate name, like `YEAR-MONTH-DAY_Name_SessionNumber`.

## Upload your homework to your github repo

Now you need to:
- _add_ your new homework file to the list of tracked files in your repository
- _commit_ your file to the repository
- _push_ your commit to the web server at github

## Sync Your Fork

We will periodically update the content in the "upstream" repository at: https://github.com/argonne-lcf/ai-science-training-series

You'll want to execute these commmands each week, just prior to the start of class, to update your personal "fork" with our latest updates.

To do this run these commands inside the directory `ai-science-training-series` where you cloned your personal fork:

You only need to do this once after you first clone your personal fork:
```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:argonne-lcf/ai-science-training-series.git
```

Then, every week, prior to class run this:
```bash
git fetch upstream main
git merge upstream/main
git push
```

This will keep your fork up to date with the ACLF repository.
