# Sambanova

## Connection to Sambanova 

Connection to a SambaNova node is a two-step process. The first step is to `ssh` to the `login node`. The second step is to log in to a SambaNova node from the `login node`.

![Sambanova connection diagram](./sambanova_login.jpg)

Login to the Sambanova login node from your local machine.  This uses the **MobilePASS+** token generated every time you log in to the system. 

In the examples below, replace ALCFUserID with your ALCF user id.
```bash
ssh ALCFUserID@sambanova.alcf.anl.gov
Password: < MobilePASS+ code >
```

Note: Use the ssh "-v" option in order to debug any ssh problems.

Once you are on the login node, ssh to one of the sambanova compute node.
```bash
ssh sn30-r1-h1       
```

It is also recommended to ssh to other compute nodes namely, `sn30-r1-h1`, `sn30-r1-h2`, `sn30-r2-h1`, `sn30-r2-h2`, `sn30-r3-h1`, `sn30-r3-h2`, `sn30-r4-h1`, `sn30-r4-h2`. Note: This avoids all your jobs being queued up on the same node.  

## Job Queuing and Submission

SambaNova uses Slurm for job submission and queueing. Below are some of the important commands for using Slurm.

* `srun` : can be used to run individual Python scripts in parallel with other scripts on a cluster managed by Slurm.
* `sbatch` :jobs can be submitted to the Slurm workload manager through a batch script by using the sbatch command.
* `squeue` : command provides information about jobs located in the Slurm scheduling queue.
* `sinfo` : is used to view partition and node information for a system running Slurm.
* `scancel` : is used to signal or cancel jobs, job arrays, or job steps.

## Hands-on Example

* [GPT-2](./gpt.md)

## Additonal Examples

* [BERT](./bert/bert.md)

##### Copy Applications to `$HOME` directory

Sambanova software stack and associated environmental variables are automatically setup at login for a SN30 node. 

Each of the samples or application examples provided by SambaNova has its own pre-built virtual environment which can be readily used. They are present in the `/opt/sambaflow/apps/` directory tree within each of the applications. This directory contains all the different models currently supported with the Sambanova software stack.

<!---
Copy them to your `$HOME` directory
```bash
cp -r /opt/sambaflow/apps/ ~
```

## Homework

For [BERT example](./bert/), understand flags used in the script. Change values for flag `--ntasks` and measure its effect on performance. Submit proof (contents printed out to your terminal, path to a logfile or screenshot) that you were able to successfully follow the instructions and execute.
