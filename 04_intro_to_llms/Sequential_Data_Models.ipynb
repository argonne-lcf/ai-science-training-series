    "1. Each sentence is different from the previous one. \n",
    "2. The sentences seem fairly disjointed, and go down weird rabbit holes after (or sometimes during) the first sentence.  \n",

    "The answer to (1) is that this kind of text prediction (like ChatGPT's) is _generative_.  The text prompt is used to contruct a probability distribution over possible completions, and each generated sentence is a _sample_ from that distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to (2) is: LLMs split up sentences into words or word fragments, called _tokens_. The way the samples are drawn is sequentially, one token at a time. Suppose the $k$-th token is denoted by the symbol $t_k$ ($t_k$ could be a word, a punctuation mark, a space, etc.). At stage $N$, the $N$-th token is drawn randomly from the distribution\n",

    "\\mathrm{Prob}(t_{N+1} | \\mathrm{prompt}, t_1, t_2,\\ldots,t_{N-1},t_N),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you are unfamiliar with this probability notation, know that an expression such as $\\mathrm{Prob}(X)$ should be read as \"the probability of occurrence of event $X$\", while the expression $\\mathrm{Prob}(X|Y)$ should be read as \"the probability of occurrence of the event $X$ _given_ that event $Y$ has been observed.\" This is called a _conditional probability_, and we often say \"Probability of $X$ conditioned on $Y$\" for $\\mathrm{Prob}(X|Y)$.  The observation of $Y$ changes the probability distribution governing the occurrence of $X$.  Here, the occurrence of the prompt, and of the first $N-1$ tokens, affects the probability distribution governing the $N$-th token $t_N$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows from this fact that the sentences start growing apart at the first token $t_1$, and, depending on the model (in this case, gpt-2), are usually more strongly influenced by recent tokens than by older ones, so that $t_{90}$ is more strongly conditioned by it's immediate predecessors $t_{89}$, $t_{88}$, and $t_{87}$ than it is by the prompt, or by $t_1$, $t_2$, or $t_3$. We would say that this model's _attention_---it's ability to maintain context over sentences and paragraphs---is quite limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to (3) is also related to the generation mechanism.  With this style of generation, it is not possible to require that the text create exactly 100-token complete sentences. The best that one could do is to run the code so as to stop after the first (or second, or third) \"End of Sentence\" (EOS) token.\n"

    "  ## Where Do Deep Learning Model Architecture Choices Come From?\n",
    "\n",
    "  From the model development view, the elements of a DL architecture are usually the result of _a lot_ of trial-and-error by researchers.  However, at a deeper level, those choices are dictated by the nature of the data itself: some strategies that are successful for some types of data are nearly pointless for other types.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For example, last week Corey Adams lectured on the application of convolutional nets---network architectures based on local convolutional kernels---to image analysis. ConvNets were a remarkable discovery in the field, which arose through the desire to exploit _local 2-D spatial structure_ in images---edges, gradients, contrasts, large coherent features, small-scale details, and so on.  Convolutional kernels, together with pooling (and some other art) turn out to be exceptionally well-adapted to discovering such structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "  On the other hand, convolutions are not as useful if the data does not have that sort of spatial structure. It would be sort of senseless to reach for convnets to model, say, seasonal effects on product sales data across different manufacturing categories, or natural language sequences (although this has been tried).\n",
    "\n",
    "  So it makes sense to think about the nature of data when approaching this field. Generally speaking, there are two broad categories of data types that have dominated DL practice: vector data, and sequential data.  This course so far has trafficked in vector data, but with LLMs, we move into the domain of sequential data.\n",

    "## Elements of DL Sequence Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017, the paper [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) (Vaswani et al.) introduced the modern _transformer architecture_. Transformers were game-changers in the subject of sequential data modeling, but in important respects they built upon elements that were already in use in existing sequential data architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which they displaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at two of those key elements that are needed by modern sequential models (AKA \"LLMs\"): tokenization, and word embedding. The third key element---attention---will be covered next week.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that unlike vector data, sequential data can have values that are essentially arbitrary---integers, real numbers, natural language words, DNA codons, and so on.  LLMs are trained and used in a manner that is largely agnostic of the data type.  This is possible because in a step preliminary to training, LLMs convert the data to _tokens_. Tokens are elements of a finite, discrete set---a _vocabulary_, with a certain fixed _vocabulary size_.  In the case of English natural language, the vocabulary may be made up of whole words, plus punctuation, spaces, etc. with a vocabulary size approaching 500,000; or it may be made up of sub-words, or word stems, or from other clever coding schemes, with reduced vocabulary size---as low as 30,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is clearly a tension represented by tokenization choice: On the one hand, there are great benefits to reducing the vocabulary size, because this can lead to substantial reductions in the number of parameters required by an LLM.  On the other hand, the actual distribution of sequence elements is more likely to be exposed to the model by more complex tokenizations, with larger vocabulary sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, take a phrase such as \"The chef added salt to the soup, because it required seasoning.\" The LLM needs to be able to parse such a sentence and discern, for example, that the article \"it\" refers to \"the soup\", and not to \"the chef\" or \"salt\" (how it does this is the subject of Attention, discussed next week).  It should be clear that such relationship are easier to tease out from a word tokenization (\"The\", \"chef\", \"added\"...) than from, say, a character-by-character tokenization (\"t\", \"h\", \"e\", \"c\"...). On the other hand, a character-by-character tokenization has a much smaller vocabulary size ($\\le 40$ including punctuation, spaces, etc.), whereas an English word-based vocabulary would have a vocabulary of about 500,000 (although the majority of these would be rarely-used words).\n",

Note that \"Counsel\" occurs frequently enough to rate its own token, and the algorithm builds \"counselor\" out of \"counsel\"+\"or\" (actually, \"##or\", where the \"##\" is a tag indicating that the token is a word piece).

The choice of this dimension is made based on a compromise between expressiveness and computational cost.

Transformers, however, adjust their embeddings during training.\n",
